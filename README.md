This project aims to generate a functional web application for a user-centric news website complete with user articles, comments, and a rating system.

## Navigating the app

The 'Home' link in the navigation bar will return you to the home page, where all available articles are listed.

Use the dropdowns on the home page to toggle which topics you would like to see and what you would like them to be sorted by.

You are automatically logged in as a User so that you can post comments and delete comments, in the future there will be an additional function to change which user you are logged in with.

To read, comment on, and vote on an article, click on an article card.

Vote on articles by clicking the buttons on its dedicated page, or leave a comment for other users to read.
